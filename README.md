## About ResQFood

ResQFood is a mobile application designed to combat food waste while supporting people in need. The app provides a platform where users can share surplus food with others in their community.

## Why ResQFood?

In Germany, each citizen throws away an average of 76kg of food per year. Extrapolated to the entire country, that's 6.3 million tons! ResQFood aims to address this problem by connecting people who have excess food with those who can use it, creating a sustainable and supportive community.
